#### (*Work-In-Progress*...)

## **_Make sense of your dives._**

dive***sense*** is a project aiming to make scuba diving knowledge accessible and transparent.
By providing divers with a platform to report diving incidents anonymously and without any judgement,
while ensuring reports credibility and data integrity,
helping divers ***make better decisions***, that ***makes sense***.

We wish to help the divers' community share their own information and experience.
We want to contribute to improved data-driven analysis and an evidence-based approach.
